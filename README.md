# Logistic Regression: Customer Churn

I will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

These models typically help marketing divisions with planning the retention programs and provide promotions and offers to the targeted customers that predicted to leave the service. 

#### The dataset includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
